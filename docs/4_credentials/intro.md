# Verifiable Credentials

We use semantic web signed claims to enable anyhing happening in Lorena.

The main library to work with Credentials is [credentials-lib](https://github.com/lorena-ssi/credential-lib)

## Add an organization

```javascript
    const credentials = require('credential-lib')
    let org = new credentials.Organization("did:lor:lab:1000")
    let keypair = await zenroom.newKeyPair('issuerID')
    await org.signCredential(keypair, 'issuerID', 'did:lor:lab:1000', 'https://github.com/lorena-ssi/lorena-gov/orgs/labtest/' + issuerID +'.md')

    const pubKey = keypair['issuerID'].keypair.public_key
    let check = await org.verifyCredential('issuerID', pubKey)
    // check is True
```
This is the process so far.
1. First we create an org object with the DID associated to it.
2. Then we create a new Keypair with Zenroom (or maybe we can reuse any key previously stored in your wallet.)
3. We can now Sign the credential.
4. Verify

## Set the member of this organizatio0n

```javascript
    let org = new credentials.Organization("did:lor:lab:1000")
    org.name('Caelum Labs')

    let developer = new credentials.Persona('did:lor:lab:1001')
    developer.fullName('John','Smith', 'Matrix')

    org.member('developer', developer)

    // Now you can sign it and send it.
```

## Create one action

```javascript
    let action = new credentials.Action("did:lor:lab:1000", 20)

    let agent = new credentials.Persona('did:lor:lab:1001')
    action.agent(agent)


    // Now you can sign it and send it.
```
