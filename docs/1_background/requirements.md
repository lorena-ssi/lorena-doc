# Requirements

We recommend to you to get familiar with the technologies we use such as [Zenroom](http://Zenroom.org), [Substrate](https://www.parity.io/substrate/) and [Matrix](https://matrix.org/).

Lorena is built over some amazing technologies. Learning about them will help you understand the basics of our technology.

## Zenroom
[Zenroom](https://dev.zenroom.org/#/?id=quickstart) is a tiny and portable virtual machine that integrates in any application to authenticate and restrict access to data and execute human-readable smart contracts.

## Substrate
[Substrate](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/tutorials/start-a-private-network/) builds upon the achievements from the major blockchain protocols, and uses the lessons learned to give developers the latest technology to build flexible blockchains.

- Built upon on industry-standard WebAssembly
- Highly extensible Libp2p networking
- Rust-based primary implementation for speed and reliability
- Javascript secondary implementation for ease of develop,emt
- WebAssembly (Wasm) interpreter, written in Rust

## Matrix
[Matrix](https://matrix.org/docs/guides/installing-synapse) is an open source project that publishes the Matrix open standard for secure, decentralized, real-time communication, and its Apache licensed reference implementations.
